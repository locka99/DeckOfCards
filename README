This is an implementation of a deck of cards written in Java and released under
the LGPLv3. This code forms the core of the ad-supported Android application
ShuffleBot which calculates Texas Hold 'Em odds. 

ShuffleBot runs hundreds / thousands of game simulations on mobile devices
so implementation of a deck is geared towards optimal performance while
maintaining a simple programming API. 

See the COPYING file for more information about LGPLv3.
